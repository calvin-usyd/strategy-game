Scenario
1. Everyone doesn't have to submit at round 1
2. round2->submit->logout->login->next round
	(currently: round2->logout->login->submit->next round)
	
Go to next round condition:
----------------------------
1. total Active  == total submitted 
	(should be: total submitted > total Active)
	
Quit condition
--------------


Active condition
----------------
action not submitted
logged in


1. Everyone doesn't have to submit at round 1
2. round2->submit->logout->login->next round
	(currently: round2->logout->login->submit->next round)

- cash = default
- share = default 
- pricePerShare = default
2. save game_user
3. check all players joined (numOfPlayer = totalPlayerAtRound0)
4. setRoundNo = 1
5.
